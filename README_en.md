# Addison ‚Üí Sage Converter (POC)
[üá©üá™ Deutsche Version](README.md)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**  
This is a **Proof of Concept** implementation based on the Sage import specification.  
The tool has **not been tested in a real production environment** with Sage.  
Use at your own risk.

## Overview
This repository contains a small Python tool that converts Addison payroll export files  
into a Sage-compatible import format. It was developed to replace an Excel/VBA macro workflow  
that required manual folder setup, file renaming, and path adjustments.

## Features
- Input: Addison export file (`.txt`, 11 columns, semicolon-separated)
- Output: Sage-compatible text file (`.txt`)
- Automatically extracts month and year
- Rearranges columns to match Sage import format
- GUI-based file selection (Tkinter) ‚Äì no manual path editing
- Can be compiled into a portable `.exe` using PyInstaller

## Motivation
The original Excel/VBA macro was error-prone and unprofessional for B2B use:
- Hardcoded file paths in the code
- Manual renaming of input files
- Strict folder structures required
- Dependence on Excel and VBA knowledge

This Python version simplifies the process by providing:
- A standalone tool
- Flexible input/output paths
- Cleaner and more robust transformation logic

## Status
- Proof of Concept (POC)
- Tested with dummy Addison export data only
- Not intended for production use

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Tkinter

## Usage
1. Run the tool (`python src/addison_to_sage.py` or compiled `.exe`).
2. Select the Addison export file via the GUI.
3. Choose an output path.
4. The converted Sage-compatible file will be saved automatically.

## Example Data
For demonstration purposes, an example file is included under `examples/dummy_addison_export.txt`.  
It contains fake data in the Addison export structure (11 columns, semicolon-separated).
